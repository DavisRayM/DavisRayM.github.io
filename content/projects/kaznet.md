An open-source, micro-tasking platform for remote locations.
<!-- more -->
Kaznet was the first significant project I had the opportunity to work on. This project was part of my internship at Ona Systems in 2018, where I contributed by developing endpoints for the <a href="https://github.com/onaio/kaznet-web" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Django Rest Framework API</a>, working on the <a href="https://github.com/onaio/kaznet-frontend" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ReactJS frontend</a>, and building the mobile application.

In addition to Kaznet, I also contributed to a Django application called <a href="https://github.com/onaio/tasking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Tasking</a>, that implements the core micro-tasking logic used in Kaznet.

You can read more about my experience during the internship in my blog post <a href="https://ona.io/home/reflecting-on-my-internship-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.

Additionally, a publication detailing the impact and results of the Kaznet project, written by various authors, is available <a href="https://www.ilri.org/knowledge/publications/kaznet-open-source-micro-tasking-platform-remote-locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.
