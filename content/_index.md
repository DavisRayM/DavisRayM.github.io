I'm a MSCS student at <a href="https://www.seattleu.edu/science-engineering/"
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Seattle University</a>. When I’m not in class, you’ll likely
find me coding a hobby project or exploring the city and discovering
restaurants. This blog is a space for sharing my thoughts on what I’m learning,
building, and discovering. Feel free to connect with me via email—I’m always
open to chat.
